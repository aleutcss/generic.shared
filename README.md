# Shared

The aleutcss `shared` module contains several high-level rulesets which apply a
consistent, shared `margin`s across a number of elements.
**Important: Be aware that this adds spacing back to a lot of elements
that are reset on generic.reset. You might not need to import both.**



## Install using npm:

```shell
    $ npm install --save-dev aleut-shared
```
